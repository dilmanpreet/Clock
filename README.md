# Clock
Clock! An analogue clock!
The clock will draw itself to a scale of 200x200.
The clock component shall scale the clock to fill the window, without distorting the clock, while keeping the clock centred.
eg: if the window is 1920x1080, the clock shall be scaled to be 1080x1080, and drawn at 420x0.
eg: if the window is 400x900, the clock shall be scaled to be 400x400, and drawn at 0x250.
The entire clock shall be drawn within a square. Draw a solid border for this square.
It shall have a round (circular) face. Draw a border for this face.
The clock shall be a 12 hour clock. No fancy 24 hour clocks!
The clock shall have a series of tick marks around its face indicating each hour.
Determine your own properties of these marks.
The four cardinal directions (0,3,6,9,12) on the clock shall have ticks that are 3 times wider.
The tick marks may have other features.
The clock shall have three visible hands
Seconds, Minutes, Hours
The hour hand shall be 2/3rds the length of the minute hand.
The hour hand shall be thicker than the minute hand.
The second hand shall be thinner than the minute hand.
The second hand shall be red (or some other contrasting colour).
Each hand may have other distinguishing features.
Each hand shall move partial distances between positions
IE: at 3:30, the hour hand shall be 1/2 way between the 3 and 4 hour marks
The clock may have other distinguishing features.
